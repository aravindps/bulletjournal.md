Bullet Journal in an plain textfile with Markdown formatting

This project is no software. It is about the idea how to use the concept of a bulletjournal in a plain textfile. The second idea is to use [markdown-formatting](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Thus, the bulletjournal-file could be used with a markdown-editor or copied into a CMS like [yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow).
